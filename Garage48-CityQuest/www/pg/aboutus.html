			<p>Hello!
			We are the creative team of developers of the "CityQuest" mobile application.<br>
			Our team consist of:
			<ul>
				<li>Kostiantyn Lapchevskyi - Team Leader</li>
				<li>Lidiia Holosko - Designer</li>
				<li>Alexandr Zagaria - System administrator</li>
				<li>Yuriy Priyma - Back-end developer</li>
				<li>Andriy Rublyov - Back-end developer</li>
				<li>Joseph Manguno - Marketer</li>
				<li>Dmytro Frolov - Mobile app</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				We started our project at the Garage48 Lviv Hackathone, where we met and came together. In the less than 48 hours of hard work and sleepless nights, we have developed "CityQuest" from the concept to product. We also created a web-site for customer quests and Facebook page to promote our project.
			</p>
			<p>
				For some members of our team it was the first experience of such kind of work, but in spite of it we have done it. Working as a team was a challange and a pleasure, so we have become friends as well as collegues.</p>
